00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:05.170 line:11 position:50% align:center size:100%
YOU KNOW, THEY TREAT ME LIKE A CRIMINAL.

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:07.339 line:11 position:50% align:center size:100%
I-I'LL END UP A CRIMINAL.

00:00:07.441 --> 00:00:09.441 line:11 position:50% align:center size:100%
YOU ARE A CRIMINAL.

00:00:10.277 --> 00:00:12.277 line:11 position:50% align:center size:100%
NOW, WHY'D YOU GOT TO GO AND DO THAT?

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:15.215 line:11 position:50% align:center size:100%
I'M TRYING TO MAKE A POINT.
WELL, WHY DON'T YOU MAKE YOUR POINT?

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.650 line:11 position:50% align:center size:100%
YOU'RE MAKING ME TIRED ALL OVER, SMALLS.

00:00:18.986 --> 00:00:21.621 line:11 position:50% align:center size:100%
WELL, FUCK IT THEN.
I HEARD YOU WERE DEAD.

00:00:21.956 --> 00:00:24.123 line:11 position:50% align:center size:100%
OH, YEAH?
WELL, YOU HEARD RIGHT.

00:00:24.458 --> 00:00:26.458 line:11 position:50% align:center size:100%
WORD I GOT IS YOU HUNG UP YOUR SPURS, MAN.

00:00:26.694 --> 00:00:29.128 line:11 position:50% align:center size:100%
WHAT'S THAT ALL ABOUT?
WHAT'S THIS?

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.640 line:11 position:50% align:center size:100%
RUMOR HAS IT KEATON'S GONE STRAIGHT.

00:00:32.666 --> 00:00:34.666 line:11 position:50% align:center size:100%
I HEAR HE'S TAPPING EDIE FINNERAN.

00:00:34.802 --> 00:00:37.403 line:11 position:50% align:center size:100%
[McManus] WHO'S THAT?
SHE'S A HEAVYWEIGHT CRIMINAL LAWYER FROM UPTOWN.

00:00:38.505 --> 00:00:40.505 line:11 position:50% align:center size:100%
I HEAR SHE'S KEATON'S MEAL TICKET.

00:00:40.641 --> 00:00:42.641 line:11 position:50% align:center size:100%
HOW 'BOUT IT, KEATON?

00:00:42.643 --> 00:00:44.643 line:11 position:50% align:center size:100%

00:00:45.246 --> 00:00:47.246 line:11 position:50% align:center size:100%
WHAT KIND OF RETAINER YOU GIVING HER?

00:00:47.348 --> 00:00:50.116 line:11 position:50% align:center size:100%
OOPS.
HEY, FENSTER,

00:00:50.718 --> 00:00:52.718
DO YOUR FRIEND A FAVOR.

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.320
TELL HIM TO KEEP QUIET.

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.560
DEAN KEATON...

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.260
GONE CLEAN, HUH?

00:01:01.128 --> 00:01:04.300
SAY IT AIN'T SO.
OR WAS IT YOU THAT HIT THAT TRUCK?

00:01:04.965 --> 00:01:07.667
MAC, MAC, FORGET HIM.
DID YOU GET TO TALK TO YOUR LAWYER?

00:01:09.803 --> 00:01:12.772
THIS WHOLE THING WAS A SHAKEDOWN.
WHAT MAKES YOU SAY THAT?

00:01:13.274 --> 00:01:15.274
HOW MANY TIMES YOU BEEN IN A LINEUP?

00:01:16.443 --> 00:01:18.443
IT'S ALWAYS YOU AND 4 DUMMIES.

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:20.679
THE P.D. ARE PAYIN' HOMELESS GUYS $10 A HEAD

00:01:20.981 --> 00:01:23.283
HALF THE TIME.
AND THERE'S NO WAY THEY'D LINE 5 FELONS IN THE SAME ROW.

00:01:24.885 --> 00:01:27.200
NO WAY.
AND WHAT'S A-- WH- WHAT'S A VOICE LINEUP?

00:01:27.688 --> 00:01:30.423
PUBLIC DEFENDER COULD GET YOU OUT OF THAT ONE.
SO, WHY THE HELL WAS I STRIP-SEARCHED?

00:01:31.292 --> 00:01:34.160
IT WAS THE FEDS.
A TRUCKLOAD OF GUNS GETS SNAGGED,

00:01:35.562 --> 00:01:37.562
CUSTOMS COMES DOWN ON TOP OF N.Y.P.D. LOOKING FOR ANSWERS.

00:01:38.198 --> 00:01:40.566
THEY COME UP WITH US.
THEY'RE CLUTCHING AT STRAWS.

00:01:40.935 --> 00:01:42.935
I HAD A GUY'S FINGER UP MY ASSHOLE TONIGHT.

00:01:42.937 --> 00:01:44.937
IS IT FRIDAY ALREADY?

00:01:46.273 --> 00:01:48.641
YEAH, LOVER BOY.
YOU WANT A PIECE?

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:50.909
JUMP IN. I'LL LOVE YOU.

00:01:50.911 --> 00:01:52.911
SO WHO IN THE GODDAMN PISS HELL STOLE OUR FUCKING TRUCK?

00:01:53.647 --> 00:01:56.482
[Groaning]
[Hockney] WHAT DID YOU SAY?

00:01:57.151 --> 00:01:59.619
WHO STOLE THE FUCKING TRUCK?
I DON'T WANT TO KNOW.

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.822
WHO ASKED YOU, WORKINGMAN?
FUCK WHO DID IT.

00:02:03.223 --> 00:02:05.625
WHAT I WANT TO KNOW IS, WHO'S THE GIMP?
[Keaton] HE'S OK.

00:02:05.726 --> 00:02:07.961
SAYS YOU. HOW DO I KNOW THAT?
WHAT ABOUT IT, PRETZEL MAN?

00:02:08.162 --> 00:02:10.129
WHAT'S YOUR STORY.
HIS NAME IS VERBAL.

00:02:11.165 --> 00:02:13.566
VERBAL KINT.
VERBAL? YEAH.

00:02:14.134 --> 00:02:16.669
ROGER, REALLY.
PEOPLE SAY I TALK TOO MUCH.

00:02:17.504 --> 00:02:19.504
YEAH, I WAS JUST GOING TO TELL YOU TO SHUT UP.

00:02:19.573 --> 00:02:22.208
WE MET BEFORE, ONCE OR TWICE.
IN COUNTY. I WAS IN FOR FRAUD.

00:02:23.277 --> 00:02:25.813
YOU WERE IN A LINEUP THEN, TOO.
WHAT HAPPENED?

00:02:25.813 --> 00:02:27.847
I WALKED.
90 DAYS, SUSPENDED.

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:30.850
SO YOU DID IT.
ALL RIGHT. NOW LOOK,

00:02:32.987 --> 00:02:34.987
WE'VE ALL BEEN PUT OUT BY THIS WHOLE THING, RIGHT?

00:02:35.923 --> 00:02:38.558
SO, I FIGURE WE OWE IT TO OURSELVES
TO SALVAGE A LITTLE DIGNITY.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.762
NOW...
ME AND FENSTER HEARD ABOUT A LITTLE JOB.

00:02:43.697 --> 00:02:45.697
WHY DON'T YOU JUST CALM DOWN?

00:02:45.833 --> 00:02:47.833
WHAT DO YOU CARE WHAT HE HAS TO SAY?

00:02:48.836 --> 00:02:50.836
I'M JUST TALKING HERE.

00:02:51.171 --> 00:02:53.773
AND IT SEEMS TO ME
LIKE MR. HOCKNEY WANTS TO HEAR WHAT I GOT TO SAY,

00:02:54.274 --> 00:02:56.274
AND I KNOW FENSTER'S DOWN.

00:02:57.111 --> 00:02:59.111
WHAT ABOUT YOU, GUY?

00:03:00.247 --> 00:03:02.247
I'M INTERESTED. SURE.

00:03:02.883 --> 00:03:05.451
THERE. SEE?
SO NOW I'D LIKE TO EXERCISE MY RIGHT

00:03:06.286 --> 00:03:08.721
TO FREE ASSEMBLY.
WHY DON'T YOU JUST SHUT UP?

00:03:15.763 --> 00:03:17.763
YOU'RE MISSING THE POINT.

00:03:17.898 --> 00:03:19.898
NO.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
YOU'RE MISSING THE POINT.

00:03:22.169 --> 00:03:24.169
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU.

00:03:25.172 --> 00:03:27.172
I DON'T CARE ABOUT YOUR JOB.

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:31.430
AND, UM...

00:03:32.312 --> 00:03:34.312
I WANT NOTHING TO DO WITH ANY OF YOU.

00:03:35.315 --> 00:03:38.170
I BEG YOUR PARDON,
BUT YOU CAN ALL GO TO HELL.

00:03:41.188 --> 00:03:43.188
[McManus] DEAN KEATON...

00:03:43.257 --> 00:03:45.257
GONE THE HIGH ROAD.

00:03:46.293 --> 00:03:48.293
WHAT IS THE WORLD COMING TO?

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.400
FUCK HIM.

00:03:59.373 --> 00:04:02.108
[Verbal] AND THAT WAS HOW IT STARTED,
THE 5 OF US BEING BROUGHT IN ON A TRUMPED-UP CHARGE

00:04:03.277 --> 00:04:05.277
TO BE LEANED ON BY HALF-WITS.

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:10.849
OK, NOW, I REALLY CAN'T TALK ABOUT IT MUCH HERE.

00:04:11.385 --> 00:04:14.320
[Verbal] WHAT THE COPS NEVER FIGURED OUT--
AND WHAT I KNOW NOW--

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:17.550
WAS THAT THESE MEN WOULD NEVER BREAK,

00:04:17.257 --> 00:04:20.226
NEVER LIE DOWN.
NEVER BEND OVER FOR ANYBODY.

00:04:22.329 --> 00:04:24.329
ANYBODY.

00:04:26.633 --> 00:04:28.633
[Buoy bell ringing]

00:04:29.903 --> 00:04:31.903
[Boat horn blowing]

00:04:39.513 --> 00:04:41.848
WHO ARE YOU?
AGENT JACK BAER, F.B.I.

00:04:42.983 --> 00:04:44.951
HOW MANY DEAD?
15 SO FAR.

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:47.286
THEY'RE STILL PULLING SOME BODIES
OUT OF THE WATER, THOUGH.

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:50.220
ANY SURVIVORS?
YEAH. THERE'S 2.

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:52.558
ONE GUY'S IN COUNTY HOSPITAL,
BUT HE'S IN A COMA.

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.495
THE D.A. HAS A 2ND GUY,
A CRIPPLE FROM NEW YORK, I THINK.

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:58.130
LISTEN, THE CHIEF WANTS THIS PLACE SEALED OFF.

00:04:58.599 --> 00:05:00.599
IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, GIVE HIM A CALL.

00:05:33.901 --> 00:05:36.569
[Telephone ringing]
THIS IS DAVE KUJAN.

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:38.870
I'LL BE IN LOS ANGELES UNTIL TUESDAY.

00:05:38.872 --> 00:05:41.700
IF YOU NEED TO REACH ME,
CONTACT JEFF RABIN

00:05:41.408 --> 00:05:44.277
OF THE SAN PEDRO POLICE DEPARTMENT
AT EXTENSION 112.

00:05:44.945 --> 00:05:47.180
HAVE A NICE DAY.
[Beeping]

00:05:50.184 --> 00:05:52.251
[Dave] WHY CAN'T I SEE HIM?
DAVE, I TOLD YOU,

00:05:52.886 --> 00:05:54.886
THE D.A. CAME DOWN HERE LAST NIGHT READY TO ARRAIGN

00:05:55.522 --> 00:05:57.522
EVEN BEFORE THEY MOVED HIM TO COUNTY, OK?

00:05:57.824 --> 00:06:00.590
KINT'S LAWYER SHOWS UP
5 MINUTES LATER,

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:02.828
THE D.A. COMES OUT OF THE OFFICE LOOKING LIKE
THE BOGEYMAN SMACKED HIM AROUND.

00:06:03.497 --> 00:06:06.132
ALL RIGHT? THEY TAKE HIS STATEMENT,
AND THEY CUT HIM A DEAL.

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:09.335
WELL, DID THEY CHARGE HIM WITH ANYTHING?
YEAH. WEAPONS-- MISDEMEANOR 2.

00:06:11.305 --> 00:06:13.305
WHAT IS THAT?

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:15.340
LISTEN, I GIVE THE D.A. CREDIT

00:06:15.342 --> 00:06:18.100
FOR GETTING THAT MUCH, DO YOU UNDERSTAND?
EXCUSE ME, SIR.

00:06:19.746 --> 00:06:21.746
THIS WHOLE THING HAS TURNED POLITICAL.

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:24.784
THE MAYOR WAS HERE LAST NIGHT.
THE CHIEF.

00:06:24.885 --> 00:06:26.885
THIS MORNING, THE GOVERNOR CALLED, OK?

00:06:27.187 --> 00:06:29.187
I'M TELLING YOU, THIS GUY IS PROTECTED FROM UP ON HIGH

00:06:30.123 --> 00:06:32.458
BY THE PRINCE OF DARKNESS.
TAKE MY WORD FOR IT.

00:06:32.659 --> 00:06:34.961
WELL, WHEN DOES HE POST BAIL?
MAYBE 2 HOURS, TOPS.

00:06:35.229 --> 00:06:37.263
WELL, I WANT TO SEE HIM.
NO, DAVE.

00:06:37.264 --> 00:06:39.366
WELL, I GOTTA SEE HIM, JEFFREY.
DAVE, NO. I CAN'T--

00:06:39.366 --> 00:06:41.934
LISTEN, YOU GOTTA DO THIS FOR ME.
I CAME A LONG WAY FOR THIS.

00:06:43.837 --> 00:06:45.837
DAVE, PLEASE.

00:06:49.142 --> 00:06:51.577
EVEN IF I LET YOU TALK TO HIM,
HE WON'T TALK TO YOU.

00:06:53.146 --> 00:06:56.480
HE'S PARANOID ABOUT BEING RECORDED.
HE KNOWS THE INTERROGATION ROOMS ARE ALL WIRED.

00:06:56.883 --> 00:06:58.851
I QUIT.
THIS WON'T BE AN INTERROGATION,

00:06:59.152 --> 00:07:01.887
JUST A FRIENDLY CHAT TO KILL SOME TIME.
HE WILL NOT GO INTO THE INTERROGATION ROOM.

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:05.570
THEN SOMEPLACE ELSE, THEN.
WHERE?

00:07:07.294 --> 00:07:09.829
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
IF THIS WAS A DOPE DEAL, WHERE'S THE DOPE?

00:07:10.931 --> 00:07:13.499
IF IT WAS A HIT, WHO CALLED IT IN?
I'M SURE YOU HAVE A HOST OF WILD THEORIES

00:07:14.868 --> 00:07:17.690
TO ANSWER ALL THESE QUESTIONS.
YOU KNOW DAMN WELL WHAT I THINK.

00:07:17.504 --> 00:07:19.504
THAT'S CRAZY. AND BESIDES, IT DOESN'T EVEN MATTER.

00:07:19.506 --> 00:07:22.308
THE GUY'S GOT TOTAL IMMUNITY.
HIS STORY CHECKS OUT.

00:07:22.809 --> 00:07:25.511
HE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT YOU WANT TO KNOW.
I DON'T THINK HE DOES, NOT EXACTLY.

00:07:27.247 --> 00:07:29.247
BUT THERE'S A LOT MORE TO HIS STORY, BELIEVE ME.

00:07:29.283 --> 00:07:31.284
JEFFREY, LOOK,
I WANNA KNOW WHY

00:07:31.618 --> 00:07:33.618
27 MEN DIED ON THAT PIER

00:07:33.987 --> 00:07:35.987
FOR WHAT LOOKS TO BE $91 MILLION WORTH OF DOPE

00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:39.525
THAT WASN'T THERE.
AND ABOVE ALL,

00:07:40.227 --> 00:07:42.227
I WANT TO BE SURE DEAN KEATON'S DEAD.

00:07:42.462 --> 00:07:45.131
HE'S DEAD.
COME ON. 2 HOURS.

00:07:45.432 --> 00:07:48.234
JUST TILL HE MAKES BAIL.
[Laughing] THEY'RE ALL DEAD.

00:07:49.202 --> 00:07:51.202
I DON'T CARE HOW TOUGH A GUY YOU SAY THIS KEATON WAS,

00:07:51.405 --> 00:07:53.405
NOBODY ON THAT BOAT COULD'VE COME OUT ALIVE.

00:07:57.711 --> 00:08:00.112
IS HE TALKING?
HE REGAINED CONSCIOUSNESS LESS THAN AN HOUR AGO.

00:08:00.614 --> 00:08:02.614
HE SPOKE-- NOT ENGLISH-- THEN HE LAPSED.

00:08:02.849 --> 00:08:05.217
HUNGARIAN. I DON'T KNOW.
I THINK THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN WHAT IT WAS.

00:08:05.686 --> 00:08:08.287
YEAH, MOST--MOST OF THEM WERE HUNGARIANS.
HERE, YOU GOTTA PUT ON ONE OF THESE.

00:08:08.655 --> 00:08:10.655
BURN VICTIMS ARE VERY SUSCEPTIBLE TO INFECTION.

00:08:11.858 --> 00:08:13.858
AND, OF COURSE, THERE'S NO SMOKING.

00:08:16.797 --> 00:08:18.797
[Monitor beeping]

00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:26.370
KEEP YOUR MASK UP. PLEASE DON'T TOUCH HIM.

00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:29.410
IS HE GONNA DIE?
HE HAS BURNS OVER 60 PERCENT OF HIS BODY.

00:08:29.543 --> 00:08:31.677
A NUMBER OF HIS RIBS ARE BROKEN--
CALL HOSPITAL SECURITY. GET A MAN

00:08:31.778 --> 00:08:34.413
PUT ON THE DOOR TILL THE POLICE GET HERE.
IS HE DANGEROUS?

00:08:34.715 --> 00:08:36.882
YES.
DO IT.

00:08:37.718 --> 00:08:39.752
DO IT NOW.
[Dialing phone]

00:08:40.354 --> 00:08:43.122
[Muttering Hungarian]
JOEL? YEAH, BAER. DOWN HERE AT L.A. COUNTY.

00:08:44.591 --> 00:08:46.591
UH, LOOK, THE GUY THEY PULLED OUT OF THE HARBOR

00:08:46.693 --> 00:08:48.693
IS ARKOSH KOVASH.

00:08:48.695 --> 00:08:50.695
YES, YES, I'M SURE.

00:08:50.964 --> 00:08:53.766
NO, HE'S ALL FUCKED UP.
[Speaking Hungarian]

00:08:54.534 --> 00:08:56.534
I CAN'T HEAR YOU.

00:08:57.370 --> 00:08:59.370
WILL YOU SHUT UP? I'M ON THE PHONE.

00:08:59.473 --> 00:09:02.441
YES.
[Yelling Hungarian]
NO, NOT TILL I PUT A MAN ON HIM.

00:09:02.609 --> 00:09:04.810
[Monitor beeping faster]
LISTEN, SEND ME SOMEONE WHO CAN SPEAK HUNGARIAN.

00:09:05.645 --> 00:09:07.880
YEAH, HE'S AWAKE.
HE'S TALKING LIKE A THAI HOOKER.

00:09:08.815 --> 00:09:10.815
...KEYSER SOZE.

00:09:11.118 --> 00:09:13.119
WHAT?
[Yelling] KEYSER SOZE!

00:09:13.954 --> 00:09:15.954
KEYSER SOZE!

00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:18.591
KEYSER--
[Coughing] SOZE.

00:09:18.625 --> 00:09:21.260
NO SHIT?
[Gasping]

00:09:21.595 --> 00:09:23.629
JOEL, YEAH,
CALL DAN METZHEISER OVER AT JUSTICE

00:09:24.464 --> 00:09:26.464
AND FIND DAVE KUJAN FROM CUSTOMS.

00:09:26.867 --> 00:09:28.934
MM-HMM.
[Cell phone closes]

00:09:47.821 --> 00:09:49.821
[Chattering]

00:10:00.767 --> 00:10:02.735
VERBAL,
THIS IS AGENT KUJAN FROM CUSTOMS.

00:10:04.871 --> 00:10:07.640
NICE TO MEET YOU.
HE WANTS TO ASK YOU A FEW QUESTIONS BEFORE YOU GO.

00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:11.577
WHAT ABOUT?
ABOUT A DEAN KEATON, MOSTLY.

00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:15.780
BUT I'D LIKE TO START AT THE LINEUP BACK IN NEW YORK.

00:10:16.249 --> 00:10:18.484
CAN I GET SOME COFFEE?
IN A WHILE. LET'S TALK ABOUT THE LINEUP--

00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:22.488
I'M REALLY THIRSTY.
I USED TO DEHYDRATE AS A KID.

00:10:23.356 --> 00:10:25.356
ONE TIME I GOT SO BAD MY PISS COME OUT LIKE SNOT.

00:10:25.625 --> 00:10:28.294
I'M NOT KIDDING. IT WAS ALL THICK AND GOOEY--
I'LL GET YOUR FUCKING COFFEE.

00:10:28.728 --> 00:10:30.728
GET ME ONE, TOO, WHILE YOU'RE AT IT.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.702
[Door opening and closing]
THAT GUY IS TENSE.

00:10:37.637 --> 00:10:40.406
TENSION IS A KILLER.
I USED TO BE IN A BARBERSHOP QUARTET

00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:43.576
IN SKOKIE, ILLINOIS.
THE BARITONE WAS THIS GUY NAMED KIP DISKIN--BIG FAT GUY.

00:10:45.178 --> 00:10:47.513
I MEAN, LIKE, ORCA FAT.
HE WAS SO STRESSED IN THE MORNING--

00:10:48.181 --> 00:10:50.181
VERBAL, YOU KNOW WE'RE TRYING TO HELP YOU.

00:10:50.350 --> 00:10:53.219
SURE. AND I APPRECIATE THAT.
AND I WANNA HELP YOU, AGENT KUJAN.

00:10:54.287 --> 00:10:56.789
I LIKE COPS.
I WOULD'VE LIKED TO HAVE BEEN A FED MYSELF BUT MY C.P.--

00:10:58.910 --> 00:11:00.910
VERBAL, YOU'RE NOT TELLIN' US EVERYTHING.

00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:03.295
I KNOW YOU KNOW SOMETHING.
[Verbal] I TOLD THE D.A. EVERYTHING I KNOW.

00:11:06.166 --> 00:11:08.166
[Kujan] VERBAL, I KNOW YOU LIKE KEATON.

00:11:09.302 --> 00:11:11.302
I KNOW YOU THINK HE'S A GOOD MAN.

00:11:11.338 --> 00:11:13.873
I KNOW HE WAS GOOD.
HE WAS A CORRUPT COP.

00:11:14.374 --> 00:11:16.374
SURE. 15 YEARS AGO, BUT HE WAS A GOOD THIEF.

00:11:17.944 --> 00:11:20.880
ANYWAY, THE COPS WOULDN'T LET HIM GO LEGIT.
DEAN KEATON WAS A PIECE OF SHIT.

00:11:25.510 --> 00:11:27.510
ARE YOU TRYING TO GET A RISE OUT OF ME, AGENT KUJAN?

00:11:28.655 --> 00:11:31.323
I JUST WANNA HEAR YOUR STORY.
IT'S ALL THERE.

00:11:32.626 --> 00:11:34.626
MAY I HAVE A CIGARETTE?

00:11:37.597 --> 00:11:39.632
ACCORDING TO YOUR STATEMENT--
I NEED A LIGHT.

00:11:43.603 --> 00:11:45.804
ACCORDING TO YOUR STATEMENT,
YOU'RE A SHORT-CON OPERATOR,

00:11:46.907 --> 00:11:48.907
RUN-OF-THE-MILL--

00:11:52.879 --> 00:11:55.481
ACCORDING TO YOUR STATEMENT,
YOU'RE A SHORT-CON OPERATOR,

00:11:57.317 --> 00:11:59.952
RUN-OF-THE-MILL SCAMS.
IT'S BEEN SUPPRESSED.

00:12:00.530 --> 00:12:02.621
ANYTHING IN THERE IS INADMISSIBLE.
OH, I KNOW.

00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:05.230
SWEET DEAL YOU HAVE HERE. TOTAL IMMUNITY.

00:12:06.590 --> 00:12:08.590
WELL, I DO HAVE THE WEAPONS CHARGE.

00:12:09.396 --> 00:12:11.396
I'M LOOKIN' AT 6 WHOLE MONTHS HARD TIME.

00:12:11.665 --> 00:12:13.665
YOU KNOW A DEALER NAMED RUBY DEEMER, VERBAL?

00:12:15.168 --> 00:12:17.168
YOU KNOW A RELIGIOUS GUY NAMED JOHN PAUL?

00:12:17.504 --> 00:12:20.720
YOU KNOW RUBY'S IN ATTICA?
HE DIDN'T HAVE MY LAWYER.

00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:23.342
I KNOW RUBY. HE'S BIG ON RESPECT.
HE'S A GOOD FRIEND OF MINE. LIKES ME VERY MUCH.

00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:27.780
NOW, I KNOW YOUR TESTIMONY IS SEALED.

00:12:27.113 --> 00:12:29.181
RUBY'S WELL CONNECTED.
HE'S GOT A LOT OF FRIENDS INSIDE

00:12:29.349 --> 00:12:31.884
DO A LOT OF FAVORS FOR HIM.
WHAT DO YOU THINK HE WOULD SAY

00:12:32.452 --> 00:12:34.452
IF HE FOUND OUT YOU DROPPED HIS NAME TO THE D.A.?

00:12:35.550 --> 00:12:37.923
THERE'S NOTHING IN THERE ABOUT RUBY.
I'LL BE SURE TO MENTION THAT TO HIM.

00:12:38.658 --> 00:12:41.427
FIRST THING ON THE JOB, YOU KNOW WHAT I LEARNED?
HOW TO SPOT A MURDERER.

00:12:42.128 --> 00:12:44.128
LET'S SAY YOU ARREST 3 GUYS FOR THE SAME KILLING.

00:12:44.164 --> 00:12:46.699
YOU PUT THEM ALL IN JAIL OVERNIGHT.
THE NEXT MORNING, WHOEVER'S SLEEPING IS YOUR MAN.

00:12:47.934 --> 00:12:50.836
YOU SEE, IF YOU'RE GUILTY, YOU KNOW YOU'RE CAUGHT.
YOU GET SOME REST. YOU LET YOUR GUARD DOWN.

00:12:51.838 --> 00:12:54.390
YOU FOLLOW ME?
NO.

00:12:54.341 --> 00:12:56.341
LET ME GET RIGHT TO THE POINT.

00:12:57.544 --> 00:12:59.544
I'M SMARTER THAN YOU,

00:12:59.546 --> 00:13:01.680
AND I'M GONNA FIND OUT
WHAT I WANNA KNOW.

00:13:02.315 --> 00:13:04.315
AND I'M GONNA GET IT FROM YOU, WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT.

00:13:05.352 --> 00:13:07.352
I'M NOT A RAT.

00:13:08.955 --> 00:13:10.955
[Door opens]

00:13:11.825 --> 00:13:14.226
[Door closes]
THANKS.

00:13:17.797 --> 00:13:20.990
AAH.
BACK WHEN I WAS PICKIN' BEANS IN GUATEMALA,

00:13:20.967 --> 00:13:23.602
WE USED TO MAKE FRESH COFFEE--
RIGHT OFF THE TREES, I MEAN.

00:13:24.371 --> 00:13:26.739
THAT WAS GOOD.
THIS IS SHIT, BUT, HEY, I'M IN A POLICE STATION.

00:13:27.874 --> 00:13:30.676
CAN WE GET STARTED AGAIN?
NOW, WHAT HAPPENED AFTER THE LINEUP?

00:13:32.412 --> 00:13:34.412
[Sirens wailing]

00:13:37.417 --> 00:13:39.652
[Woman] THE DESK SERGEANT
WAS ACTUALLY TRYING TO TELL ME

00:13:39.786 --> 00:13:41.887
THAT HE COULDN'T RELEASE YOU.
I MEAN, CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT?

00:13:42.122 --> 00:13:45.900
YOU WEREN'T EVEN CHARGED.
DAMN POLICE.

00:13:48.328 --> 00:13:50.328
YOU KNOW, I WANNA HAVE PICTURES TAKEN OF YOUR FACE.

00:13:50.730 --> 00:13:52.899
I'LL TAKE THEM TO THE D.A.'S OFFICE
FIRST THING TOMORROW MORNING.

00:13:52.899 --> 00:13:55.000
FORGET ABOUT IT.
ABSOLUTELY NOT! I'M GONNA HAVE THIS THING

00:13:55.402 --> 00:13:57.703
IN FRONT OF THE GRAND JURY BY MONDAY.
LOOK, I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT, EDIE, OK?

00:14:01.641 --> 00:14:03.641
SO WHAT DID FORTIER AND RENAULT SAY?

00:14:04.244 --> 00:14:06.244
THEY ASKED FOR SOME MORE TIME TO THINK ABOUT INVESTING.

00:14:06.546 --> 00:14:08.480
DAMN IT.
[Horn honking]

00:14:08.581 --> 00:14:11.500
MORE TIME FOR WHAT, EDIE?
NO MATTER HOW YOU COVER MY TRACKS,

00:14:11.685 --> 00:14:13.685
THEY'RE STILL-- THEY'RE STILL GONNA FIND OUT ABOUT ME.

00:14:13.953 --> 00:14:16.922
GIVE ME SOME CREDIT.
I GOT YOU THIS FAR.

00:14:17.257 --> 00:14:19.458
LET'S GO TO THE GRAND JURY.
YOU KNOW, THIS ISN'T GONNA STOP IF WE DON'T--

00:14:20.930 --> 00:14:22.930
IT'S NEVER GOING TO STOP PERIOD.

00:14:23.290 --> 00:14:25.597
BY NEXT WEEK, EVERY INVESTOR IN THE CITY
IS GONNA BE WALKING AWAY FROM US.

00:14:27.834 --> 00:14:29.835
[Sighs]
IT'S FINISHED.

00:14:30.403 --> 00:14:32.403
I'M FINISHED.

00:14:37.510 --> 00:14:39.510
DON'T GIVE UP ON ME NOW, DEAN.

00:14:41.748 --> 00:14:43.748
IT'S NEVER GONNA STOP.

00:14:46.252 --> 00:14:49.154
[Car horn blaring]
[Siren wailing]

00:14:51.910 --> 00:14:53.910
I LOVE YOU.

00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:55.460
THEY RUINED ME IN THERE TONIGHT.

00:14:57.764 --> 00:14:59.764
I LOVE YOU.

00:15:00.734 --> 00:15:02.734
DO YOU HEAR ME?

00:15:09.750 --> 00:15:11.750
WHAT?

00:15:12.779 --> 00:15:14.779
ALL RIGHT.

00:15:15.215 --> 00:15:17.215
LET'S JUST GO TO MY PLACE.

00:15:21.121 --> 00:15:23.121
[Subway clanking]

00:15:32.532 --> 00:15:34.532
WE'LL WORRY ABOUT THIS TOMORROW.

00:15:38.638 --> 00:15:40.638
YEAH. LET'S GO.

00:15:42.675 --> 00:15:45.430
[Verbal] FENSTER AND MCMANUS
HAD A CAGEY PROPOSITION--

00:15:45.445 --> 00:15:47.445
A FAST-JUMP, HIGH-RISK, LONG MONEY.

00:15:48.448 --> 00:15:51.316
WE ALL KNEW IT COULD BE DONE.
THE WAY I FIGURED,

00:15:51.518 --> 00:15:54.219
TO DO IT WRONG MEANT KILLING.
TO DO IT RIGHT TOOK 5 MEN.

00:15:55.855 --> 00:15:57.855
5 MEN MEANT KEATON.

00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:00.958
KEATON TOOK CONVINCING.

00:16:03.363 --> 00:16:05.363
NEW YORK'S FINEST TAXI SERVICE.

00:16:06.432 --> 00:16:08.432
BULLSHIT.

00:16:08.501 --> 00:16:10.501
BULLSHIT.

00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:13.400
THEY DON'T OPERATE ANYMORE.

00:16:13.306 --> 00:16:16.241
MCMANUS HAS A FRIEND IN THE 14TH PRECINCT.
THEY'RE COMING OUT FOR ONE JOB, THURSDAY.

00:16:17.443 --> 00:16:19.678
THEY'RE PICKIN' UP A GUY
SMUGGLING EMERALDS OUT OF SOUTH AMERICA.

00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:22.280
MCMANUS ALREADY HAS A FENCE SET TO TAKE THE STUFF.

00:16:22.315 --> 00:16:24.383
A FENCE? WHO?
SOME GUY IN CALIFORNIA. HIS NAME'S REDFOOT.

00:16:25.318 --> 00:16:28.200
I NEVER HEARD OF HIM.
YOU HAVE TO COME.

00:16:28.388 --> 00:16:31.230
WHAT'S IT TO YOU WHETHER I DO IT OR NOT?
THEY DON'T... THEY DON'T KNOW ME.

00:16:31.991 --> 00:16:34.159
YOU DO.
THEY WON'T TAKE ME UNLESS YOU GO.

00:16:35.862 --> 00:16:37.862
LOOK AT ME. I NEED THIS.

00:16:38.598 --> 00:16:40.598
OH, YOU'RE TELLING ME YOU DON'T NEED THIS?

00:16:40.667 --> 00:16:43.302
IS THIS YOUR PLACE?
LOOK, I'M NOT KNOCKING YOU.

00:16:43.870 --> 00:16:46.538
YOU LOOK LIKE YOU GOT A GOOD SCAM GOING WITH THIS LAWYER.
OH!

00:16:47.140 --> 00:16:49.140
[Gasping]

00:16:50.543 --> 00:16:52.543
SORRY.

00:16:52.645 --> 00:16:54.645
IT'S OK. IT'S OK.

00:16:55.782 --> 00:16:58.116
YOU SAY IT'S THE REAL THING?
THAT'S COOL.

00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:03.722
YOU OK?
I WAS OUT OF LINE.

00:17:05.191 --> 00:17:07.593
BUT THEY'RE NEVER GONNA STOP WITH US.
YOU KNOW THAT.

00:17:08.127 --> 00:17:10.462
AS CLEAN AS YOU COULD EVER GET,
THEY'LL NEVER LET YOU GO NOW.

00:17:10.930 --> 00:17:13.498
THIS WAY, WE HIT THE COPS WHERE IT HURTS,
AND WE GET WELL IN THE MEANTIME.

00:17:15.134 --> 00:17:17.134
[Sighs]

00:17:18.872 --> 00:17:20.872
YOU SURE YOU'RE OK?

00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:23.140
I'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

00:17:37.190 --> 00:17:39.190
LOOK, I, UH...

00:17:39.325 --> 00:17:41.460
SOMETIMES GET...
FORGET IT.

00:17:45.198 --> 00:17:47.198
I'LL PROBABLY SHIT BLOOD TONIGHT.

00:17:47.767 --> 00:17:49.767
[Laughing]

00:17:58.544 --> 00:18:00.544
SO, UH...

00:18:02.448 --> 00:18:04.448
HOW DO THEY WANNA DO IT?

00:18:05.818 --> 00:18:08.287
MCMANUS WANTS TO GO IN SHOOTING.
I SAY NO.

00:18:10.189 --> 00:18:12.190
FENSTER?
HOCKNEY?

00:18:12.725 --> 00:18:14.725
THEY'RE PRETTY PISSED OFF. THEY'LL DO ANYTHING.

00:18:15.695 --> 00:18:17.695
NOW, I GOT A WAY TO DO IT WITHOUT KILLING ANYONE,

00:18:17.797 --> 00:18:19.898
BUT LIKE I SAY,
THEY WON'T LET ME IN WITHOUT YOU.

00:18:39.218 --> 00:18:41.218
$3 MILLION?

00:18:42.555 --> 00:18:45.290
MAYBE MORE.
[Scoffing]

00:18:48.561 --> 00:18:50.561
NO KILLING.

00:18:51.631 --> 00:18:53.631
NOT IF WE DO IT MY WAY.

00:19:27.533 --> 00:19:30.200
[Verbal] NEW YORK'S FINEST TAXI SERVICE
WAS NOT YOUR NORMAL TAXI SERVICE.

00:19:30.737 --> 00:19:32.737
IT WAS A RING OF CORRUPT COPS IN THE N.Y.P.D.

00:19:33.639 --> 00:19:36.740
THAT RAN A HIGH-PROFIT RACKET
DRIVING SMUGGLERS AND DRUG DEALERS

00:19:36.442 --> 00:19:38.643
ALL OVER THE CITY.
FOR A FEW HUNDRED A MILE,

00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:41.380
YOU GOT YOUR OWN BLUE AND WHITE
AND A POLICE ESCORT.

00:19:41.848 --> 00:19:44.483
THEY EVEN HAD THEIR OWN BUSINESS CARDS.
AFTER A WHILE, SOMEBODY STARTED ASKING QUESTIONS,

00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:48.787
AND THE TAXI SERVICE SHUT DOWN.
EVER SINCE THEN,

00:19:48.855 --> 00:19:51.890
INTERNAL AFFAIRS HAS BEEN WAITING
TO CATCH THEM IN THE ACT.

00:19:51.457 --> 00:19:54.426
AND THAT'S WHERE WE CAME IN.
SO, HOW WAS THE FLIGHT?

00:19:55.610 --> 00:19:57.610
FUCKIN' GREAT.

00:19:58.431 --> 00:20:00.431
WILL THIS GET ME TO STATEN ISLAND?

00:20:01.601 --> 00:20:03.568
ARE YOU KIDDIN' ME?
THIS WILL GET YOU TO CAPE COD.

00:20:04.504 --> 00:20:07.272
[Verbal] MCMANUS CAME TO US WITH THE JOB.
FENSTER GOT THE VANS.

00:20:07.573 --> 00:20:10.275
HOCKNEY SUPPLIED THE HARDWARE.
I CAME THROUGH WITH HOW TO DO IT SO NO ONE GOT KILLED.

00:20:11.844 --> 00:20:14.413
BUT KEATON?
KEATON PUT ON THE FINISHING TOUCH--

00:20:15.515 --> 00:20:17.682
A LITTLE "FUCK YOU"
FROM THE 5 OF US TO THE N.Y.P.D.

00:20:22.455 --> 00:20:24.656
WATCH THIS. WATCH THIS.
[Brakes squealing] WHOA. WHOA. WHOA.

00:20:24.824 --> 00:20:27.325
CAREFUL. CAREFUL. CARE--
COME ON, ASSHOLE.

00:20:29.228 --> 00:20:31.228
HOLY SHIT!

00:20:31.564 --> 00:20:33.865
DON'T MOVE, YOU FUCKER!
DROP IT NOW, MOTHERFUCKER!

00:20:34.767 --> 00:20:37.302
DROP THE FUCKING GUN. DROP IT!
DON'T MOVE!

00:20:37.603 --> 00:20:40.172
[Fenster] DON'T FUCKING TOUCH A FUCKING THING.
WHAT DO YOU GUYS WANT?

00:20:40.773 --> 00:20:42.941
PUT YOUR FUCKIN' THING AWAY.
WE'RE COPS!

00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:45.100
STUPID ASSHOLES!
WATCH THE GLASS!

00:20:45.111 --> 00:20:48.460
DON'T FUCKIN' MOVE, MOTHERFUCKER!
YOU WANT A BUCKSHOT SHAMPOO, CHUBBY?

00:20:48.781 --> 00:20:50.916
SHUT UP!
WHOA! WHOA! WHOA!

00:20:51.684 --> 00:20:53.684
AW, FUCK.

00:20:56.489 --> 00:20:59.570
AFTERNOON, MY LITTLE PORK CHOPS.
NOW, GIVE ME THE SHIT.

00:20:59.292 --> 00:21:01.760
DON'T MOVE! GIVE HIM THE FUCKING SHIT!
GIVE HIM THE FUCKIN' THING! GIVE HIM THE FUCKIN' THING!

00:21:02.728 --> 00:21:04.728
GIVE HIM THE FUCKIN' SHIT, MAN!

00:21:04.964 --> 00:21:06.998
HURRY UP!
COME ON!

00:21:07.333 --> 00:21:09.468
NOW THE MONEY!
THERE'S NO MONEY. GIVE ME THE MONEY!

00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:12.404
THERE'S NO FUCKIN' MONEY.
GIVE ME THE MONEY!

00:21:12.972 --> 00:21:15.307
GIVE HIM THE FUCKING MONEY!
DO IT! GIVE HIM THE MONEY!

00:21:15.641 --> 00:21:17.709
GIVE ME THE FUCKIN' MONEY!
GIVE HIM THE MONEY!

00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:20.440
HURRY UP!

00:21:20.313 --> 00:21:22.313
YOU KNOW THE FUCKIN' WHO-- YOU KNOW WHO THE FUCK I AM?

00:21:22.448 --> 00:21:24.448
YOU PEOPLE KNOW WHO THE FUCK I AM?

00:21:24.650 --> 00:21:26.785
FUCK!
WE DO NOW, JERK-OFF.

00:21:28.321 --> 00:21:30.321
COCKSUCKER.

00:21:34.460 --> 00:21:36.496
WAIT A MINUTE.
WHAT'S THAT?

00:21:36.496 --> 00:21:38.496
[Sniffing]

00:21:38.898 --> 00:21:41.399
WHAT THE FUCK--
HOLY SHIT!

00:21:44.570 --> 00:21:46.570
GO! GO! GO!

00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:49.840
[Tires screeching]

00:21:58.684 --> 00:22:00.785
[Verbal] KEATON MADE
AN ANONYMOUS PHONE CALL.

00:22:01.287 --> 00:22:03.287
THE PRESS WAS ON THE SCENE BEFORE THE POLICE WERE.

00:22:03.389 --> 00:22:05.389
STRAUSZ AND RIZZI WERE INDICTED 3 DAYS LATER.

00:22:05.925 --> 00:22:07.925
WITHIN A FEW WEEKS, 50 MORE COPS WENT DOWN WITH THEM.

00:22:09.950 --> 00:22:11.963
EVERYBODY GOT IT RIGHT IN THE ASS--
FROM THE CHIEF ON DOWN.

00:22:12.832 --> 00:22:14.832
IT WAS BEAUTIFUL.

00:22:22.642 --> 00:22:24.642
I OWE YOU $2.50.

00:22:25.745 --> 00:22:28.380
DR. KEATON.
?[Music playing]

00:22:29.882 --> 00:22:32.551
THERE'S MORE HERE THAN I THOUGHT.
WHEN'S THE FENCE COMING?

00:22:33.819 --> 00:22:36.221
REDFOOT NEVER COMES TO SEE ME.
I ALWAYS GO TO SEE HIM.

00:22:37.823 --> 00:22:39.823
IN CALIFORNIA?

00:22:40.393 --> 00:22:43.328
YES, VERBAL, IN CALIFORNIA.
FENSTER AND I--

00:22:43.529 --> 00:22:46.164
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT. HOLD THE FUCKIN' PHONE.
YOU AND FENSTER?

00:22:46.465 --> 00:22:48.767
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
YOU FUCKIN' KIDDIN' ME?

00:22:49.335 --> 00:22:51.335
OK, SO, THEN WHO'S GONNA GO?

00:22:52.438 --> 00:22:54.438
WE ALL GO.

00:22:55.508 --> 00:22:57.508
WHAT'S YOUR FUCKIN' PROBLEM, MAN?

00:22:58.440 --> 00:23:00.440
MY FUCKIN' PROBLEM, MAN, IS THAT YOU AND FENSTER

00:23:00.146 --> 00:23:02.547
ARE OFF HONEYMOONING IN CALIFORNIA
WHILE THE REST OF US ARE SITTIN' HERE HOLDING OUR DICKS.

00:23:03.616 --> 00:23:05.850
HEY!
THE JOB'S OVER.

00:23:06.886 --> 00:23:09.721
COOL IT.
L.A.'S A GOOD PLACE

00:23:09.855 --> 00:23:11.855
TO LIE LOW FOR A WHILE.

00:23:14.327 --> 00:23:16.327
YOU WANT TO DANCE?

00:23:23.135 --> 00:23:25.135
LADIES.

00:23:29.408 --> 00:23:31.408
[Chuckling]

00:23:32.378 --> 00:23:34.378
I WOULD LIKE TO PROPOSE A TOAST.

00:23:35.581 --> 00:23:37.515
THERE YOU GO.
[Patting]

00:23:39.652 --> 00:23:41.652
TO MR. VERBAL--

00:23:42.855 --> 00:23:44.855
THE MAN WITH THE PLAN.

00:23:49.795 --> 00:23:51.795
[Car horn blaring]

00:23:58.170 --> 00:24:00.170
WE'RE GONNA MISS THE FLIGHT.

00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:02.707
DON'T DO THIS.
SEND HER A NOTE. SOMETHING.

00:24:04.543 --> 00:24:06.543
I SAID WE'LL MAKE IT.

00:24:40.179 --> 00:24:42.179
WE'RE GONNA MISS THE PLANE.

00:24:43.616 --> 00:24:45.616
SHE'LL UNDERSTAND.

00:25:04.837 --> 00:25:07.639
THAT'S HEARTWARMING.
REALLY.

00:25:09.442 --> 00:25:11.442
I'M WEEPY.

00:25:11.911 --> 00:25:13.911
JEFF, YOU WANNA WAIT OUTSIDE?

00:25:17.183 --> 00:25:19.183
YOU GUYS WANTED TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENED AFTER THE LINEUP.

00:25:19.452 --> 00:25:21.519
I'M TELLING YOU.
COME ON, VERBAL.

00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:24.880
WHO DO YOU THINK YOU'RE TALKIN' TO?

00:25:24.423 --> 00:25:26.423
YOU EXPECT ME TO BELIEVE THAT HE RETIRED?

00:25:27.927 --> 00:25:29.927
FOR A WOMAN?

00:25:31.197 --> 00:25:33.965
BULLSHIT.
KEATON WAS USING HER.

00:25:34.433 --> 00:25:36.602
HE LOVED HER.
SURE.

00:25:36.602 --> 00:25:38.970
I'M SUPPOSED TO BELIEVE
THAT HITTING THE TAXI SERVICE WASN'T HIS IDEA EITHER.

00:25:40.139 --> 00:25:42.741
IT WAS ALL FENSTER AND MCMANUS.
COME ON. KEATON WAS A COP FOR 4 YEARS.

00:25:43.976 --> 00:25:46.945
WHO ELSE WOULD KNOW THE TAXI SERVICE BETTER?
THAT JOB HAD HIS NAME WRITTEN ALL OVER IT.

00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:50.181
BUT EDIE HAD HIM ALL TURNED AROUND.
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING.

00:25:51.500 --> 00:25:53.785
I KNOW DEAN KEATON.
I'VE BEEN INVESTIGATING HIM FOR THE PAST 3 YEARS.

00:25:55.654 --> 00:25:57.654
THE GUY I KNOW WAS A COLD-BLOODED BASTARD.

00:25:58.657 --> 00:26:00.657
I.A.D. INDICTED HIM ON 3 COUNTS OF MURDER

00:26:00.826 --> 00:26:02.826
BEFORE HE WAS KICKED OFF THE FORCE.

00:26:02.928 --> 00:26:04.928
SO DON'T SELL ME THE HOOKER WITH A HEART OF GOLD.

00:26:05.297 --> 00:26:07.297
YOU GOT HIM ALL WRONG.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:10.702
DO I?
DEAN KEATON WAS UNDER INDICTMENT

00:26:11.170 --> 00:26:13.438
A TOTAL OF 7 TIMES
WHILE HE WAS ON THE FORCE.

00:26:14.140 --> 00:26:16.741
IN EVERY CASE, WITNESSES EITHER
REVERSED THEIR TESTIMONY TO THE GRAND JURY,

00:26:18.210 --> 00:26:20.210
OR DIED BEFORE THEY COULD TESTIFY.

00:26:21.313 --> 00:26:23.313
WHEN THEY FINALLY DID NAIL HIM FOR FRAUD,

00:26:23.516 --> 00:26:25.516
HE SPENT 5 YEARS IN SING SING.

00:26:25.885 --> 00:26:27.885
HE KILLED 3 PRISONERS INSIDE.

00:26:28.387 --> 00:26:30.387
OF COURSE, I CAN'T PROVE THIS,

00:26:31.857 --> 00:26:33.857
BUT I CAN'T PROVE THE BEST PART EITHER.

00:26:35.828 --> 00:26:38.630
DEAN KEATON WAS DEAD.
[Laughing]

00:26:38.697 --> 00:26:41.990
DID YOU KNOW THAT?
HE DIED IN A FIRE 2 YEARS AGO,

00:26:42.134 --> 00:26:44.235
DURING AN INVESTIGATION
INTO THE MURDER OF A WITNESS

00:26:44.637 --> 00:26:46.637
WHO WAS GOING TO TESTIFY AGAINST HIM.

00:26:47.173 --> 00:26:49.841
2 PEOPLE SAW DEAN KEATON
WALK INTO A WAREHOUSE HE OWNED

00:26:50.242 --> 00:26:52.242
JUST BEFORE IT BLEW UP.

00:26:52.378 --> 00:26:54.378
THEY SAID HE WENT IN TO CHECK A LEAKING GAS MAIN.

00:26:56.248 --> 00:26:58.248
IT BLEW UP AND TOOK ALL OF DEAN KEATON WITH IT.

00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:02.920
WITHIN 3 MONTHS OF THE EXPLOSION,

00:27:03.389 --> 00:27:05.389
THE 2 WITNESSES, THEY WERE DEAD.

00:27:05.991 --> 00:27:07.991
ONE KILLED HIMSELF IN HIS CAR.

00:27:08.260 --> 00:27:10.260
THE OTHER FELL DOWN AN OPEN ELEVATOR SHAFT.

00:27:12.565 --> 00:27:15.400
[Monitor beeping]
[Woman] AGENT BAER.

00:27:15.401 --> 00:27:18.103
LET'S GET THIS SHOW ON THE ROAD.
THIS IS NOT WHAT WE DISCUSSED. THERE ARE TOO MANY--

00:27:18.103 --> 00:27:20.438
LOOK, LOOK, DOCTOR.
DOCTOR, I PROMISE WE'LL BE OUT OF HERE

00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:23.740
BEFORE HE BLOWS HIS PORCH LIGHT, OK?
I HAVE A NOON MEETING, BAER.

00:27:23.576 --> 00:27:25.610
AGENT BAER, 5 MINUTES.
LOOK, EVERYONE, JUST CALM DOWN, ALL RIGHT?

00:27:26.545 --> 00:27:29.800
I WANT YOU TO ASK THIS MAN
ABOUT THE SHOOTOUT IN THE HARBOR.

00:27:32.218 --> 00:27:34.218
[Speaking Hungarian]

00:27:36.288 --> 00:27:38.288
[Speaking Hungarian]

00:27:41.794 --> 00:27:44.162
UH, HE SAYS THEY WERE BUYING--
DOPE. WE KNOW.

00:27:45.498 --> 00:27:47.498
[Kovash speaking Hungarian]

00:27:50.736 --> 00:27:52.736
HE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT THEY WERE BUYING, BUT NOT DOPE.

00:27:52.938 --> 00:27:55.774
UH...PEOPLE.
WHAT?

00:27:55.774 --> 00:27:57.774
[Speaking Hungarian]

00:28:03.616 --> 00:28:05.616
HE NEEDS GUARANTEES--

00:28:05.751 --> 00:28:08.860
WHAT IS HE TALKING ABOUT, GUARANTEES?
HE SAYS HIS LIFE IS IN DANGER.

00:28:10.550 --> 00:28:12.550
UH, HE SAW THE DEVIL,

00:28:12.258 --> 00:28:14.926
L-LOOKED HIM IN THE EYE.
I'M ON MY WAY.

00:28:15.127 --> 00:28:17.595
NO, NO, NO, WAIT A MINUTE. WAIT A MINUTE.
ASK HIM TO TELL HIM WHAT HE TOLD ME.

00:28:19.398 --> 00:28:21.366
UH,
ABOUT THE DEVIL... WHO'S THE DEVIL?

00:28:23.202 --> 00:28:25.202
[Speaking Hungarian]

00:28:28.841 --> 00:28:30.841
KEYSER SOZE.

00:28:31.377 --> 00:28:33.377
[Speaking Hungarian]

00:28:35.214 --> 00:28:37.815
KEYSER SOZE?
YEAH, HE--HE WAS IN THE HARBOR, KILLING MANY MEN.

00:28:40.219 --> 00:28:43.540
HE SAW KEYSER SOZE?
[Speaking Hungarian]

00:28:48.327 --> 00:28:50.795
HE--HE SAW HIS FACE.
ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT. LOOK.

00:28:51.630 --> 00:28:53.630
TELL HIM TO TELL HER WHAT HE LOOKS LIKE.

00:28:54.233 --> 00:28:56.234
DESCRIBE HIM.
UH, OK, AH,

00:28:56.335 --> 00:28:58.335
[Speaking Hungarian]

00:29:02.841 --> 00:29:04.909
[Kujan] 6 WEEKS AGO,
I GET AN ANONYMOUS PHONE CALL

00:29:04.977 --> 00:29:07.412
TELLING ME I COULD FIND KEATON
EATING AT MONDINO'S WITH HIS ATTORNEY,

00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:11.150
AND THERE HE IS.
NOW, BECAUSE HE NEVER PROFITED

00:29:11.183 --> 00:29:13.183
FROM HIS ALLEGED DEATH,

00:29:13.218 --> 00:29:15.587
AND BECAUSE WE CONVICTED SOMEONE ELSE
OF THE MURDER WE TRIED TO PIN ON HIM,

00:29:16.889 --> 00:29:18.889
WE HAD TO LET HIM GO.

00:29:19.458 --> 00:29:21.593
HE WAS DEAD JUST LONG ENOUGH
FOR THE MURDER RAP TO BLOW OVER.

00:29:22.695 --> 00:29:24.695
AND THEN HE HAD LUNCH.

00:29:24.797 --> 00:29:26.797
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT.

00:29:26.799 --> 00:29:28.799
WELL, I DON'T THINK YOU DO.

00:29:28.968 --> 00:29:30.968
BUT YOU SAY YOU SAW KEATON DIE.

00:29:31.537 --> 00:29:33.805
I THINK YOU'RE COVERING HIS ASS,
AND HE'S STILL OUT THERE SOMEWHERE.

00:29:34.373 --> 00:29:36.373
I THINK HE'S BEHIND THAT WHOLE CIRCUS AT THE HARBOR.

00:29:36.775 --> 00:29:38.775
MY BET IS HE'S USING YOU BECAUSE YOU'RE STUPID

00:29:38.877 --> 00:29:41.379
AND YOU THINK HE'S YOUR FRIEND.
YOU TELL ME HE'S DEAD, SO BE IT.

00:29:43.616 --> 00:29:45.717
I WANNA BE SURE HE'S DEAD
BEFORE I GO BACK TO NEW YORK.

00:29:45.951 --> 00:29:47.951
HE WASN'T BEHIND ANYTHING. IT WAS THE LAWYER.

00:29:49.421 --> 00:29:51.421
WHAT LAWYER?

00:29:51.690 --> 00:29:53.791
WHAT LAWYER, VERBAL?
YOU KNOW, BACK WHEN I WAS IN

00:29:53.926 --> 00:29:56.728
THAT BARBERSHOP QUARTET IN SKOKIE, ILLINOIS--
YOU DON'T THINK I KNOW YOU HELD OUT ON THE D.A.?

00:29:58.230 --> 00:30:00.999
WHAT DID YOU LEAVE OUT OF THAT TESTIMONY?
I COULD BE ON THE PHONE TO RUBY DEEMER IN 10 MINUTES.

00:30:02.167 --> 00:30:04.836
THE D.A. GAVE ME IMMUNITY.
NOT FROM ME.

00:30:05.404 --> 00:30:07.404
YOU GET NO IMMUNITY FROM ME, YOU PIECE OF SHIT.

00:30:07.606 --> 00:30:10.408
EVERY CRIMINAL I HAVE PUT IN PRISON,
EVERY COP THAT OWES ME A FAVOR,

00:30:11.176 --> 00:30:13.176
EVERY CREEP AND SCUMBAG THAT WALKS THE STREET FOR A LIVING,

00:30:13.612 --> 00:30:16.347
WILL KNOW THE NAME OF VERBAL KINT.
NOW, YOU TALK TO ME,

00:30:16.849 --> 00:30:18.849
OR THAT PRECIOUS IMMUNITY THEY SEEM SO FIT TO GRANT YOU,

00:30:19.118 --> 00:30:21.619
WON'T BE WORTH THE PAPER THE CONTRACT
PUT OUT ON YOUR LIFE IS PRINTED ON.

00:30:25.524 --> 00:30:27.524
THERE WAS A LAWYER.

00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:30.560
KOBAYASHI.

00:30:30.963 --> 00:30:33.297
IS HE THE ONE THAT KILLED KEATON?
NO, BUT I'M SURE KEATON IS DEAD.

00:30:36.402 --> 00:30:38.402
CONVINCE ME.

00:30:38.470 --> 00:30:40.470
AND TELL ME EVERY LAST DETAIL.

00:31:00.250 --> 00:31:02.226
[Verbal] WE ARRIVED IN LOS ANGELES
AND MET MCMANUS' FENCE, REDFOOT.

00:31:04.430 --> 00:31:06.430
HE HAD A GOOD REPUTATION.

00:31:06.432 --> 00:31:09.300
SEEMED LIKE A GOOD GUY.
STILL, WE SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BETTER.

00:31:10.369 --> 00:31:12.370
HOW YOU DOING?
GOOD. YOU?

00:31:12.504 --> 00:31:14.504
NOT BAD. CAN'T COMPLAIN.

00:31:15.340 --> 00:31:17.340
HOW'S IT GOING, FENSTER?

00:31:18.110 --> 00:31:20.110
DON'T NEED TO OPEN IT, RIGHT?

00:31:26.118 --> 00:31:28.118
YOU MUST BE KEATON.

00:31:28.887 --> 00:31:30.887
REDFOOT, DEAN KEATON.

00:31:30.956 --> 00:31:33.524
TODD HOCKNEY AND VERBAL KINT.
VERBAL, THE MAN WITH THE PLAN, HUH?

00:31:35.794 --> 00:31:38.329
YOU GUYS INTERESTED IN ANY MORE WORK?
TSK. WE'RE ALWAYS LOOKING FOR EXTRA WORK.

00:31:39.531 --> 00:31:42.233
WE'RE ON VACATION.
OH, WELL, THAT'S TOO BAD.

00:31:44.603 --> 00:31:46.603
I GOT A TON OF WORK AND I DON'T HAVE ANY GOOD PEOPLE.

00:31:47.720 --> 00:31:49.140
NOT LIKE YOU GUYS.
WHAT'S THE JOB?

00:31:49.541 --> 00:31:51.541
THERE'S THIS JEWELER OUT OF TEXAS NAMED SAUL.

00:31:52.311 --> 00:31:54.311
HE RENTS A SUITE IN SOME DOWNTOWN HOTEL.

00:31:54.713 --> 00:31:57.448
HE DOES FREE APPRAISALS FOR PEOPLE.
SOMETIMES HE BUYS, SOMETIMES HE DOESN'T.

00:31:58.517 --> 00:32:00.517
ANY WAY, THE WORD IS, HE CARRIES AROUND A LOT OF CASH.

00:32:01.787 --> 00:32:03.787
SO I FIGURE, I KEEP THE MERCHANDISE,

00:32:04.523 --> 00:32:07.258
YOU KEEP THE GREEN.
SIMPLE.

00:32:07.426 --> 00:32:09.660
WHAT ABOUT SECURITY?
A COUPLE OF BODYGUARDS.

00:32:09.962 --> 00:32:11.962
NOTHING YOU COULDN'T HANDLE.

00:32:12.197 --> 00:32:14.197
[McManus] GIVE ME TIME TO CHECK IT OUT?

00:32:14.399 --> 00:32:16.399
I EXPECT NOTHING LESS FROM YOU, MAN.

00:32:17.903 --> 00:32:19.903
GOOD TO SEE YOU. WE'LL CALL YOU. ALL RIGHT.

00:32:20.339 --> 00:32:22.339
ENJOY L.A., HUH? GET YOURSELF LAID.

00:32:23.275 --> 00:32:25.275
HEY, UH...

00:32:27.846 --> 00:32:30.515
A FRIEND IN NEW YORK TELLS ME
THAT YOU KNOW, UH, THAT YOU KNEW SPOOK HOLLIS.

00:32:32.818 --> 00:32:34.818
THE WAY I HEAR IT, YOU DID TIME WITH OL' SPOOK.

00:32:36.210 --> 00:32:38.210
A GOOD MAN, WASN'T HE?

00:32:38.223 --> 00:32:40.223
I USED TO RUN DOPE FOR HIM.

00:32:40.893 --> 00:32:43.227
TOO BAD HE GOT SHIVVED.
YEAH.

00:32:45.197 --> 00:32:47.197
I SHIVVED HIM.

00:32:48.767 --> 00:32:51.102
BETTER YOU HEAR IT FROM ME NOW
THAN FROM SOMEBODY ELSE LATER.

00:32:53.772 --> 00:32:55.772
I APPRECIATE THAT.

00:32:56.942 --> 00:32:59.877
BUT JUST OUT OF CURIOSITY,
WAS IT BUSINESS OR PERSONAL?

00:33:03.982 --> 00:33:05.982
A BIT OF BOTH.

00:33:07.190 --> 00:33:09.190
WELL, LIKE I SAID,

00:33:09.540 --> 00:33:11.540
YOU GIVE ME A CALL IF YOU'RE INTERESTED, HUH?

00:33:16.610 --> 00:33:18.610
IS THERE A PROBLEM?

00:33:19.498 --> 00:33:22.200
ONE JOB.
THAT WAS THE DEAL.

00:33:28.106 --> 00:33:30.675
[McManus] ONE JOB?
[Laughing]

00:33:32.377 --> 00:33:34.377
ONE JOB?

00:33:35.314 --> 00:33:37.314
THAT'S A GOOD ONE, KEATON.

00:33:37.416 --> 00:33:39.416
[Laughing]

00:33:39.518 --> 00:33:42.320
[Verbal] KEATON FOUGHT IT AS BEST HE COULD,
BUT A MAN CAN'T CHANGE WHAT HE IS.

00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:45.857
HE CAN CONVINCE ANYONE HE'S SOMEONE ELSE,
BUT NEVER HIMSELF.

00:33:46.358 --> 00:33:49.260

ARE YOU GONNA KILL HIM? I'M GONNA DEAL WITH HIM.

YOU BETTER DEAL WITH HIM, OR I'M GOING TO.
SHUT UP.

00:36:55.280 --> 00:36:57.280
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO WITH THAT?

I DON'T KNOW. FEED IT TO THE GIMP.
EASE HIS PAIN. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS.

00:37:06.892 --> 00:37:08.892
I DON'T KNOW. SOME LIMEY.

00:37:09.127 --> 00:37:11.127
HE'S A MIDDLEMAN FOR SOMEBODY, OK?

00:37:11.329 --> 00:37:13.597
HE DOESN'T SAY, I DON'T ASK.
YOU'RE FUCKIN' FULL OF SHIT!
